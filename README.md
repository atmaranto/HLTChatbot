# HLTChatbot
 A simple chatbot project done by Anthony Maranto and Usaid Malik for Human Language Technologies, focusing on game information.
 
 While this README is fairly sparse, we have extensive examples in the supplied Jupyter notebooks. These are meant to be run in
 Google Colab.
  * `HLT_Chatbot_Project.ipynb` contains our base testing notebook for the project, with no fancy presentation stuff implemented.
    Running all the cells in it will let you interact with the bot at the bottom.
  * `HLT_Chatbot_Project_Presentation.ipynb` contains our "presentation notebook," with everything automated for a presentation.
    You're meant to run everything before the `bot = GameBot()` cell automatically (using "Run Before" or similar) and then run
    everything after that one-at-a-time.
  * `HLT_Chatbot_Project_Presentation_Empty.ipynb` is the same as above, but I've cleared out all of the outputs from my previous
    test run, so you can see the bot produce the results as though they're novel.
